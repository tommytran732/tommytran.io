Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thien, but I mostly go by "Tommy" nowadays. I am an Linux system administrator around 4 years of experience. I am familiar with most major Linux families, from Red Hat to Debian to SUSE to Arch Linux. Recently, my interest has shifted to immutable distributions such as Fedora Silverblue/CoreOS and openSUSE MicroOS.

Like most Linux users, I am an open source enthusiast and publish most of the projects made in my free time on [GitHub](https://github.com/tommytran732). I also made a couple of small contributions to various projets on GitHub as well.

I have a collaborative blog - [PrivSec.dev](https://privsec.dev) - with a couple of friends I "met" through [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org).
