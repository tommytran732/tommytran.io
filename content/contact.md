I highly recommend that you contact me via Matrix, so we could take advantage of their end to end encryption. My Matrix is [@tommy:arcticfoxes.net](https://matrix.to/#/@tommy:arcticfoxes.net).

In case you do not have a Matrix account, you can sign up for one on my homeserver [arcticfoxes.net](https://arcticfoxes.net) or on [matrix.org](https://app.element.io). Alternatively, check out [joinmatrix.org](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/) for a list of public homeservers. I do not ask for your email address or any personal information for registration on [arcticfoxes.net](https://arcticfoxes.net). All you need to provide is a username and password.

If you prefer to reach out to me via email, my address is contact@tommytran.io. You can use my [PGP Key](/tommy.asc) to encrypt the messages. Aliases:

- tommy@privsec.dev
- tommy@arcticfoxes.net

I am available on Twitter as well:

- [@TommyTran732](https://twitter.com/tommytran732)
- [@PrivSec_Dev](https://twitter.com/privsec_dev)

My Git accounts:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/tommytran732)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tommytran732)
- [Gitea](https://git.tommytran.io/tomster)

Please by wary of anyone claiming to be me or using the handle "TommyTran732" reaching out to you. Chances are, they are an impersonator. You can always contact me via Matrix or Email for identity verification.
