I run some public services that you could use:

- [ArcticFoxes.net](https://arcticfoxes.net), a small Matrix homeserver for cool nerds to hang around. Registration is open.

- My own [Gitea instance](https://git.tommytran.io). It currently is a mirror of my public repositories and a few other projects that I find interesting. Registration is closed.

I am quite busy right now, but I am looking at deploying Mastodon and PrivateBin in the near future. When the Gitea federation comes to fruition, I will consider converting my private Gitea instance into a public one under [ArcticFoxes.net](https://arcticfoxes.net) as well.
